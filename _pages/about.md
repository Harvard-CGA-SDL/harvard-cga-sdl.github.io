As a part of the [NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center project](https://www.stcenter.net/), the [Spatial Data Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/chinadatalab) is co-sponsored by the Future Data Lab and KNIME. The project aims to promote the development of a new generation of methodologies and technologies for spatial data analysis, spatial data sharing, and applied research in the fields of spatiotemporal innovation, including population, business, environment, and health. The main tasks of the spatial data lab include: (1) spatial data services; (2) development of spatial data analysis platform and tools; (3) development of case studies based on workflow data analysis for replicable, reproducible and expandable research; and (4) spatial data science training.

The project are guided by an independent [academic advisory committee](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/chinadatalab/advisory-committee-0) formed by world-renowned scholars with a diverse background of research domains.
